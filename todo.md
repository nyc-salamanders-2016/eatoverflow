TODO:

comments - not working. make the routes restful?

dry out the score counting - does it store correctly?

Users should be able to respond to both questions and answers. Rresponses should just be a flat list.

The person who posted a question can declare one of the user-submitted answers "the best."

Users should be able to vote on questions, answers, and responses (both upvotes and downvotes) - only once.


Stretch:
Responses should be sorted chronologically, with oldest first.

Answers should be sorted by "the best" first, followed by most highly-voted.

Users should be able to see questions sorted three ways: highest-voted, most recent, and "trending."
